"Down on your luck, and coin, you decide to make your way to ye-old Agency. Unsuprisinng there is a short line tailing outside of the door way.  You hop in line and patiently wait for for your turn to be called.  Just when you as your turn is about to be called a grumpy kobold cuts you in line and starts walking up to the service counter."
 "Defend your spot in the line!"  "Let it go."

if "defend"

Not talking any shit from the kobold, you grab him by the shoulder and fling him out the line.  Now even madder than before he starts cursing you out, trying to bait you into a fight.

"fight"  "ignore"

if ignore

 Not caring about the small angry reptile, who you have really pissed off, you walk up to the desk as the elf at the counter calls for the next person in line. "Sorry that the asshole cut you off" she began. "I don't know why we still let him in here." She took a look back at kolbold and let out a deep sigh.  You turn around to look at the kolbold watching  as his scaly hand slowly drift towards the dagger has holstered.  "Security" she shouts, and in the blink of an eye a armored dragonborn, the size of a small-hill giant grab  the kobold, and hurls him out the door. "Now how can I help you?""

 if fight

   This was the wrong day to piss you off.  With out any warning you charge the kolbod, even though he was egging you on, you can see by his terrified expression he was not ready for it. With a mighty boot to the chest, the kobold flies a couple feet back. As he lands on his ass you hear the elf at the counter call "Next", and you walk up to the counter. "Sorry that the asshole cut you off" she began. "I don't know why we still let him in here." She took a look back at kolbold and let out a deep sigh.  You turn around to look at the kolbold watching his scaly hand slowly drift towards the dagger has holstered.  "Security" she shouts, and in the blink of an eye a armored dragonborn, the size of a small-hill giant grab  the kobold, and hurls him out the door. Now how can I help you?

 if let it go

 Deciding it was not worth it to agro the koblold you let him take you spot in line. He saunters up to the desk and begins the ardous task of changing his address.  Patiently you wait, but he is starting to hold up the entire line with his unprepared shenananigans.  Finally it all boils over as the kobold erupts in anger that he does not anything that constitutes a proper proof of address, the elf at the counter ask him to step aside. He walks off to the side cursing loudly,  Paying no mind to the visibly disturbed kobold you walk up to the line.
